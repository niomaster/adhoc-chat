    \section{Packets}
    \subsection{Structure of all packets}
    The following list describes the structure of all packets. All bytes are sent in sequence as a single UDP datagram packet.

    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ID: A nonce that is unique per source ip address. (4 bytes)
        \item Flags: 8 Bits of flags. (1 byte)
        \item Sequence number: The sequence number of the packet, measured in number of packets, if applicable. (4 bytes)
        \item Acknowledgement number: The last acknowledged packet, if applicable. (4 bytes)
        \item Source IP: The IPv4 source of this packet. (4 bytes)
        \item Destination IP: The IPv4 destination of this packet. (4 bytes)
        \item Data: The data of this packet, if applicable. (n bytes)
    \end{enumerate}
    \subsection{Announce}
    This is the first packet that is sent when a client is booted. This packet simultaneously indicates to other clients that it intends to join the network and asks these other clients to send a synchronization.
